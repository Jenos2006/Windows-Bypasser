# How to use is it?

    ## Step 1: Copy the Script

    Highlight the entire script you want to run (e.g., main).
    Right-click on the highlighted text and select Copy (or press Ctrl + C on your keyboard).

    ## Step 2: Open PowerShell as Administrator

    - Press the Windows key on your keyboard to open the Start menu.
    - Type PowerShell in the search bar.
    - In the search results, locate Windows PowerShell.
    - Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and choose Run as administrator from the dropdown menu.
    - If a User Account Control (UAC) prompt appears, click Yes to allow administrative permissions.

    ## Step 3: Paste and Run the Script

    - In the PowerShell window, move your mouse to the top of the PowerShell window (the title bar).
    - Right-click on the title bar and select Edit, then click Paste to insert the script.
    - After pasting the script, press Enter to execute it.

    ## Troubleshooting

    - If the script doesn’t start: Press Enter again, as the input might need an extra acknowledgment.
    - If it still doesn’t work:
        Check if your antivirus software is blocking the script. Many antivirus programs block PowerShell scripts as a precaution.
        To verify, temporarily disable your antivirus and try running the script again. If the script works after disabling the antivirus, adjust your antivirus settings to allow PowerShell scripts.
